Should your friend check the application daily just to get to know about the status? But don’t you think it would result in a lot of unnecessary visits to the application which were definitely not required. Or you may think about that each time you add the new feature and send the notification to each user. Is it OK? Sometimes yes but not every time.

    "The strategy method is Behavioral Design pattern that allows you to define the complete family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and putting each of them into separate classes and also allows to interchange there objects. It is implemented in Python by dynamically replacing the content of a method defined inside a class with the contents of functions defined outside of the class. It enables selecting the algorithm at run-time. This method is also called as Policy Method."

So. everything was going with ease and there was no difficulty for maintaining such a simple application for a developer but as time passes, the owner of the departmental store demands for including some other types of discount also for the customers. It is very easy to say to make these changes but definitely not very easy to implement these changes in an efficient way."
